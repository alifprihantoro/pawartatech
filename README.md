## Tech

### Why Astro
Astro allows for the creation of fast, modern websites with ease. It supports partial hydration, meaning only the necessary JavaScript is loaded, which improves performance. Additionally, Astro's flexibility means you can easily switch from Blogger to Node.js or other providers without being locked into a specific vendor.

### Why Blogger
Blogger is a free platform that offers stability and security. It's a reliable choice for hosting content without worrying about server maintenance or costs.

### Why Tailwind
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that is highly customizable and easy to integrate with any JavaScript framework. It also supports Language Server Protocol (LSP), providing intelligent code completion and error checking, which enhances the development experience.

### Why Daisy
DaisyUI is a component library that works seamlessly with Tailwind CSS. It provides a set of pre-designed components that are simple to use and easy to customize, speeding up the development process and ensuring a consistent design.
